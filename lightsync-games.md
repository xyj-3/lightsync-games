# Lightsync integrated games list

This is a list of games that have **integrated / game-driven lighting** on Logitech devices through Lightsync. 

NOTE: This list is crowdsourced and incomplete, therefore I cannot guarantee its accuracy. It is partner to my [list of all profile-supported games in G HUB](https://github.com/xyj013/g-hub-supported-games/blob/master/g-hub-games-list.md) (which is complete).

If you know of a game that has integrated lighting that is not on this list, or if you see an error and would like to contribute, please open an issue or pull request. Please add a newline and follow the alphabetical ordering if you would like to add a game through pull request.
